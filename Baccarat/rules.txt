 To play this game, the minimum amount to bet is $20
with  $100 being the maximum

Two cards are randomly drawn for both the player and banker, with the highest number being 9 when the two cards are added for each side. The side with the highest number wins the draw. 
However, if the number surpasses 9 it is considered as 0. With number 11 being considered as 1;

Example:
Should in case the 2 cards are drawn for the player side with number  6 and 9
and two cards are drawn for the banker side with numbers 3 and 6; 

when the player cards are added together, it is considered player is 5 
and banker is 9, so the banker wins this draw. 

So you can consider using this formula when the banker or player is greater than 9. 
 total number of the side - 10 

if you select a side and it turns out to have the highest number, your money is doubled 
but if you choose the opposite side, you lose all of your money


Moreover, if you select tie and both sides of the game have the same number at the end of the draw, you will win 8 times of your bet. however, if you place your bet on a tie and it turns out player or banker win, you will lose 
your money
